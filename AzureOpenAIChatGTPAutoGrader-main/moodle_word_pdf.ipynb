If a student submits a zip file, it will also unzip it in their folder. The folder should contain either some Docx files or one PDF file. For Docx files, the notebook will extract and merge all the texts into one answer. For PDF files, it will only extract the text from the first page as the answer.\n",

    "The notebook will use Azure OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 to get the embedding of the answer. It will then use K-means clustering to group the answers based on their embeddings and show the teachers the different types of answers. It will also perform PCA on the embeddings and plot the first three principal components in 3D. This will help the teachers see how similar or different the answers are."

      "environment to learn and improve (El Naqa et al., 2015). In more recent years, machine\n",
      "learning has become more widely used; this has been driven by the development of new\n",
      "theories and practical applications. As well as the rapid increase in accessible online data\n",
      "and affordable computing power (M., 2015).\n",
      "In this landscape, cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure have emerged as powerful tools for\n",
      "deploying AI models. Specifically, Microsoft Azure is a public cloud computing platform\n",
      "developed by Microsoft (Borra, 2024). This product provides a comprehensive range of\n",
      "services but the most relevant for this project is Azure AI Studio, this provides developers\n",
      "with the ability to create an AI model and deploy it in a secure environment.\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, most universities currently mark dissertations by selecting two\n",

      "this method may be outdated, and replacing one marker for an AI could be possible, or\n",
      "adding a third marker in the form of AI.\n",

      "assignment marking (Henderson-Brooks, n.d.). The benefits include saving time and\n",
