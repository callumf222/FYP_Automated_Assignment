    "# Automatic Grader with Azure OpenAI ChatGPT\n",
    "This notebook can grade studentsâ€™ assignments automatically by downloading them from Moodle LMS. It will unzip the assignment file from Moodle and create a folder for each student. If a student submits a zip file, it will also unzip it in their folder. The folder should contain either some Docx files or one PDF file. For Docx files, the notebook will extract and merge all the texts into one answer. For PDF files, it will only extract the text from the first page as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will then use a marking scheme as prompts and let Azure OpenAI ChatGPT evaluate the answer according to the rules. It will also estimate the probability that the answer is copied from the internet or generated by AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will use Azure OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 to get the embedding of the answer. It will then use K-means clustering to group the answers based on their embeddings and show the teachers the different types of answers. It will also perform PCA on the embeddings and plot the first three principal components in 3D. This will help the teachers see how similar or different the answers are."

      "7. Discussion of verification and validation: You have addressed verification and validation throughout the report, showing the approach taken. However, more detailed and thorough explanation and justification of these processes would enhance this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Evaluation against requirements: Since no requirements were provided, there was no evaluation against them. It would be beneficial to establish clear requirements for your project and evaluate its success in meeting those requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Evidence of project planning and management: Unfortunately, there is no evidence of project planning and management discussed in your report. To improve this section, include details about your overall project plan, time-scales, resources, and work schedule. Additionally, explain any deviations from the plan and demonstrate the use of appropriate project management methodologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Attributes of the solution: Since no solution was provided, there is no basis to evaluate the attributes of the solution. It is important to present your solution in order to assess its quality and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Summary, conclusions, and recommendations: Your summary and conclusions are well-defined and reflect the important points of your research. However, it would be beneficial to include a final summary review to tie together the main findings and recommendations from your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Structure and presentation: Overall, your report has a good structure and presentation. You have used appropriate headings and subheadings, and the report is generally easy to read. Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, grammar, and syntax to further enhance the quality of your work.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Overall understanding and reflection: While your understanding of the topic is evident, the lack of a clear solution limits the opportunity for reflection. It would be valuable to provide a concrete solution and reflect on its strengths and weaknesses based on your research.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, your project shows potential, but there are areas where improvement is needed. I encourage you to address the points mentioned above and consider how you can refine your project to achieve a higher level of quality. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional support.\n",
