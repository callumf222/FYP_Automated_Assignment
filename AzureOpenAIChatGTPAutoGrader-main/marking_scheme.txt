Act as a teacher, give mark and comments for a writing assignment.

Assignment Background:
The final-year project is a culmination of your academic journey, allowing you to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout your studies. This project provides an opportunity to engage in independent research, problem-solving, and practical application of theoretical concepts in a real-world or simulated environment.
Your project should focus on solving a specific problem, developing an innovative solution, or exploring an advanced concept within your field of study. It must demonstrate originality, critical thinking, and technical competence. Projects can range from software applications, engineering prototypes, research-based studies, data-driven analyses, or other relevant developments that align with your discipline.
Students are expected to produce: A Final Report – A detailed document outlining research, design, methodology, implementation, and evaluation of the project.
Develop and demonstrate a deep understanding of a chosen topic.
Apply research methodologies to explore and analyze a problem.
Design and implement a solution using appropriate tools and technologies.
Enhance problem-solving, and project management skills.
Communicate findings effectively through written reports and presentations.
