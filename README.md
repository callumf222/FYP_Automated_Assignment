# FYP_Automated_Assignment
Automated Assignment Marking VIA Azure ChatGPT. This is developed in Python for my final year project.


This project can grade studentsâ€™ assignments automatically by downloading them from Moodle. It will unzip the assignment file from Moodle and create a folder for each student. If a student submits a zip file, it will also unzip it in their folder. The folder should contain either some Docx files or one PDF file. For Docx files, the notebook will extract and merge all the texts into one answer. For PDF files, it will only extract the text from the first page as the answer.

The notebook will then use a marking scheme as prompt and let Azure OpenAI ChatGPT evaluate the answer according to the rules. It will also estimate the probability that the answer is copied from the internet or generated by AI.
